Variables:
str (short for string) -> almost anything written usually between quotation marks
int (short for integer)

There are many more data types, but as a start, knowing these four will be good enough and the rest will come along the way.
Every veriable is overwritable. i.e. the new defination overwrites the previous defination of a variable. (eg. name = 'Dog' is defined first and if we defing name = 'Cat' now, it will replace 'Dog' with 'Cat'
