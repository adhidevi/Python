Machine Learning:

It is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics. It is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI). It is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

Data Set:

In the mind of a computer, a data is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.

IMP:: This is what Machine Learning is for! Anysizing data and predicting the outcome!

Data Types:

To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with. We can split the data types into three main categories:

1) Numerical -> These data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories::

  (a) Discrete Data -> numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.

  (b) Continuous Data -> numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item.

2) Categorical -> These data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values. 

3) Ordinal -> Thses data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and som on.
